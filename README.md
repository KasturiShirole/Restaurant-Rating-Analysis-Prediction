# Restaurant-Rating-Analysis-Prediction
Conducted end-to-end exploratory, statistical, geospatial, and predictive analysis on a restaurant dataset using Python and libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

1. Used EDA techniques to clean and preprocess 9K+ restaurant records and engineered features like name/address length, binary flags (online delivery/table booking).
2. Visualized restaurant distribution using Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium to uncover rating trends across cities, cuisines, and geolocations.
3. Built multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict aggregate ratings, achieving an RÂ² score of 0.945.
4. Performed customer preference analysis to identify top-rated and most-voted cuisines using groupby aggregation and bar plots.
5. Created interactive visual dashboards to communicate insights like rating distributions, city-wise comparisons, and feature correlations.
